DieStatistician is a toolset for analyzing tabletop game dice outcomes.

The name is a pun:
1. Statisician of a Die. A statistician studying dice. Die is the singular form
of dice.
2. (You) Die, statistician. A command requesting that some ungainly statistician
should cease to exist.

How to use:
1. run python
2. from XdY import XdY
3. generate one six-sided die: a = XdY( [1,6] )
4. generate three eight-sided dice added together: b = XdY( [3,8] )
5. compare them:
5.1. a == 3 ... a > 6 ... a > 1 ... a == 0
5.2. b == 9 ... 8 > b ... 3 > b ... a == b
doesn't work: 3 <= a <= 5
